A recipe app built with html, css and Vanilla JavaScript. 
For this project I worked on the JavaScript which involved making use of the forkify recipe API. 
I made use of the MVC architecture alongside the Publisher Subscriber Pattern to put together the structure of the entire app. 
The app functionalities include making search for diffferent recipes, 
the app also allows for uploading personal recipes as well as bookmarking favourite recipes.
